## pIpe

ifttt is awesome for popular channels like Twitter, Facebook, Email etc. But if you want to customize channels to use any json or xml feed it isn't of much help.

pIpe is ifttt like library for websites/webservices linked to webservices/smartphones/desktops with advanced filters.

It is the ultimate in web automation. It will even work for website content.

See [Hacker News Gtalk Alert](https://github.com/sathish316/pIpe/blob/master/examples/hacker_news_gtalk_alert.rb) for example

```
hacker_news = Pipe::Input::HackerNews.new(url: 'http://apify.heroku.com/api/hacker_news.json')
iphone5_post = Pipe::Filter::JSONContains.new(attribute: 'title', contains: 'iPhone5')
gtalk_message = Pipe::Output::Gtalk.new(recipient: 'john@gmail.com', message: 'Found iPhone 5 post in HackerNews')
Pipe::Pipe.new(hacker_news, iphone5_post, gtalk_message).execute
```

To run this alert like ifttt, add [this script](https://github.com/sathish316/pIpe/blob/master/examples/hacker_news_gtalk_alert.rb) to crontab.

To install:

```
gem install pipe
```

Add to Gemfile:

```
gem 'pipe'
```
